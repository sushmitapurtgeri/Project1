        <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on 15 October 1931,
             to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram
              on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.
               His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9]
                his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that
                 took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
                 Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been
                  wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. 
                  Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent
                   from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the
                    mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland 
                    and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed
                     and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family 
                     was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the
                      family's meager income.
